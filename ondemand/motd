#### Notes

Setup python environment for using Jupyter:

    source /usr/local/jupyter/2.1.4/bin/activate


In a production deployment you may also need to configure your identity provider to set frame-ancestors directive in the HTTP Content-Security-Policy. For example `frame-ancestors https://*.osc.edu 'self'` was required at OSC for https://ondemand.osc.edu because of its use of iFrames to facilitate single signon with XDMoD.
